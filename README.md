- Iâ€™m @tommogoweb3. I am a self-starter and fast learner, pivoting into Web3 and blockchain tech with many years of business development experience in highly complex and fast-moving environments. Looking to leverage existing business skills and expand on newly acquired technicaL knowledge in the crypto space.
- ðŸ‘€ Generally, my web3 interests include ETH scaling solutions, DeFi, NFTs, future ways of working aka DAOs, and GameFi.
- I've dabbled in Solidity, web3.js, and am currently filling the gaps by learning Computer Science Basics, including C, Javascript and Python.

Thanks for visiting my github page.
