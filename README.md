👋 Hello there!
- I’m @tommogoweb3, with expertise in business development, P&L management and partner negotiations. I have decided to quit my job in big tech, and go all in on web3 - to put it simply, I'm betting on myself.
- 👀 Generally, my web3 interests include DeFi, NFTs, future ways of working aka DAOs, and GameFi.
- I'm currently learning Solidity, web3.js to start with.
- ALso, I'm always open to chatting about anything web3 (and basketball) related, you can find me: @tommogoweb3 on twitter.

Have a good one!

Tommogo
